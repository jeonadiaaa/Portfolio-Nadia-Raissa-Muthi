Hello, my name is Nadia Raissa Muthi, a recent graduate from the Mathematics Program at Institut Teknologi Sumatera (ITERA).

During my studies, I developed a strong interest in data processing, quantitative analysis, and digital-based administrative documentation. I have applied this interest through various projects, assignments, and supporting activities — all of which I have compiled into a portfolio.

This portfolio serves as both a documentation and a reflection of my skills, including:
✔ Systematically managing and analyzing data
✔ Using various statistical and mathematical analysis tools such as Excel, R, and Python
✔ Creating informative and communicative data visualizations
✔ Preparing well-structured and organized digital reports and documentation

This portfolio also reflects my commitment to detail, accuracy, precision, and professional work ethics.

I am pleased to share this portfolio with you all, and I hope it provides a clear picture of the skills and values I bring into the workplace.

Thank you for your time.

Warm regards,
Nadia Raissa Muthi
